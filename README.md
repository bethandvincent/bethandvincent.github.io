# Welcome to Irreplaceable

This is version 0.1 of Irreplaceable, a tool to help you find and recruit diverse team members. 

Traditional methods of recruitment (CVs, cover letters, etc.) don't seem to be cutting the mustard anymore. Both for applicants and employers. In an industry where both technical knowledge and people skills are important, it's no longer enough judge people against the limitations of their previous role, a discrete list of skills or where they went to school.

These old methods of recruitment also uphold processes which are biased against certain attributes and backgrounds and can be a blocker in recruiting a diverse (in all the ways humans can be) teams. 

Great team members bring their individual differences as strengths, so why do we expect to recruit everyone the same old way?
